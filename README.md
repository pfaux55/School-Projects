Below is a list of the projects included in this repository. Each project has its own folder containing the source code, documentation, and any additional resources.

Java Projects:

Project 1: LetterCrush, A Grid Puzzle Game

Description: This project implements a Java-based match-3 puzzle game with a grid of characters. It includes two main classes: LetterCrush, which manages the grid by populating it, applying gravity to make characters fall, removing matching lines, and handling cascading effects; and Line, which represents horizontal and vertical line segments on the grid. The game features the ability to find and remove the longest lines of matching characters, and it continuously applies gravity and removal operations until the grid stabilizes. Technologies used include Java, 2D arrays, and object-oriented programming.

Project 2: Factorial with Recursion

Description: A Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion and handles user input validation. Technologies: Java, Scanner (for user input). Project Details: This program prompts the user to enter a positive integer (1-100), validates the input, and then displays the factorial of the entered number.
