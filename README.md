Projects

Below is a list of the projects included in this repository. Each project has its own folder containing the source code, documentation, and any additional resources. Files that do not start with an @ were provided by the school.

### Java Projects:
#### Project 1: Factorial with Recursion

Description: A Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion and handles user input validation.
Technologies Used: Java, Scanner (for user input).
Project Details: This program prompts the user to enter a positive integer (1-100), validates the input, and then displays the factorial of the entered number.

#### Project 2: FrogPath, A Pathfinding Simulation

Description: This project simulates a frog navigating across a hexagonal grid pond, optimizing its path to consume flies while avoiding obstacles such as alligators and mud. The frog prioritizes landing on lily pads and reeds, leveraging a unique priority queue for path selection and a stack for path tracing. The simulation adapts to varied terrain and obstacles, using different cell types to represent the pond environment.
Technologies Used: Java, pathfinding, priority queues, stacks, object-oriented programming.

#### Project 3: LetterCrush, A Grid Puzzle Game

Description: This project implements a Java-based match-3 puzzle game with a grid of characters. It includes two main classes: LetterCrush, which manages the grid by populating it, applying gravity to make characters fall, removing matching lines, and handling cascading effects; and Line, which represents horizontal and vertical line segments on the grid. The game features the ability to find and remove the longest lines of matching characters, and it continuously applies gravity and removal operations until the grid stabilizes.
Technologies Used: Java, 2D arrays, object-oriented programming.

#### Project 4: LinkedNumberConversion, A Linked List Number Representation and Base Conversion

Description: This project involves the implementation of a number representation using a linked list, facilitating operations such as base conversion, digit manipulation, and validation within a specified numerical base. It supports initializing numbers from strings or integers, adding or removing digits at specific positions, and converting numbers between different bases. Custom exceptions are used to handle specific error cases related to the linked list operations and base conversions.
Technologies Used: Java, linked lists, custom exceptions, base conversion, object-oriented programming. 

#### Project 5: QuadrantTree, A Spatial Data Structure for Image Representation and Processing

Description: This project implements a Quadrant Tree (Q-Tree) data structure to represent and process images. Each node in the tree encapsulates properties for a specific quadrant of an image, including its size, color, and position. The tree supports operations such as determining if a point lies within a node's quadrant, subdividing nodes, and finding nodes at specified levels. Additionally, the program can find pixels within an image that are the same color and display images at higher and lower resolutions using the average color of a quadrant, making it useful for efficient image processing and querying spatial data.
Technologies Used: Java, tree data structures, image processing, object-oriented programming.

### Python Projects:

#### Project 6: Tweet Sentiment Analysis

Description: This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets based on keywords with assigned sentiment values. It prompts the user to input a TSV file containing keywords and their sentiment values, and a CSV file containing tweets and their metadata. The program calculates sentiment scores for each tweet, classifies them as positive, neutral, or negative, and generates a report including the average sentiment value for favorited and retweeted tweets. The output is written to a TXT file, providing a comprehensive analysis of the tweet dataset.
Technologies Used: Python, file I/O, data processing, sentiment analysis.

#### Project 7: Library System

Description: This project implements a basic library management system, allowing users to manage a collection of books. Users can add new books with details such as name, author, edition, and ISBN, borrow books based on search criteria, return borrowed books using their ISBN, and view a list of all books with their availability status. The system maintains records of all books, tracks borrowed and available books, and keeps a log of users who have borrowed each book. The user interacts with the system through a menu-driven interface.
Technologies Used: Python, file I/O, data structures, user input validation, object-oriented programming.

#### Project 8: Shopping Cart System

Description: This project implements a comprehensive shopping cart system, including inventory management, shopping cart functionality, and a product catalog. The system allows users to manage products with attributes such as name, price, and category. Users can add or remove products from the inventory, add items to their shopping cart, view the contents of their cart, and categorize products by price. The program also includes functionality to populate the inventory and product catalog from CSV files, making it suitable for managing a dynamic shopping environment.
Technologies Used: Python, object-oriented programming, file I/O, data structures.
